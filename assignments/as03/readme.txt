Lomuto Quick Sort Findings
*Ran out of time so I was only able to do one test per test case

After observing, 5 is one of the best numbers to use for Lomuto partitioning 

nums.txt        = Text file with 1000 randomly listed numbers
sortedNums.txt  = Text file with 1000 listed numbers in ascending order

Tests Cases:

0:
sortedNums.txt time:   0m0.026s
nums.txt time:         0m0.021s

5:
sortedNums.txt time:   0m0.020s
nums.txt time:         0m0.016s

10:
sortedNums.txt time:   0m0.021s
nums.txt time:         0m0.017s

20:
sortedNums.txt time:   0m0.022s
